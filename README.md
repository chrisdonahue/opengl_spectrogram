opengl_spectrogram
==================

using JUCE to create a 3D spectrogram drawn with OpenGL

JOS Fork Info:
* Got it building and running on Mac OS Ventura, but after loading a wav file, it crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS in glDrawElements() trying to draw a grid.
* Next step is to try it on an Intel Mac, then maybe Linux.
